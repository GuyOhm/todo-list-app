# Performance Audits

## Introduction
We will present performance audits both for our todo list web app and one of our concurrent: [todolistme.net](http://todolistme.net/).
Based on results, we will formulate some recommandations and grasp some insights we could use for our own web app.

## Audits environment
Performance audits will be conducted with the following tools:
- Chrome dev tools in private mode
- [Dareboost](https://www.dareboost.com/)

We will also use Network dev tools inspector to investigate the content and duration of each requests.

### Chrome dev tools configuration
We will run performance audits for desktop device with and without network throttling.
